## Routing & Navigation
* In this section, I have created my examples in ```../exercises/exercise-routing-navigation/examples```. 
* There exists a module called ```Router```, in Angular.
    * Angular modules include:
        * ```Router```
        * ```Forms```
        * ```Reactive Forms```
        * ```Http```
* There are 3 steps to navigation in Angular:
    * Configure routes
        * A route is the mapping of a path to a component.
    * Add a router outlet
        * This is where is we display the corresponding component when a given route becomes active.
    * Add links
* Configuring Routes
