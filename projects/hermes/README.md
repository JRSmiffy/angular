## Overview
* This e-commerce site (Hermes) is the final project of ```The Complete Angular Course: Beginner to Advanced```, by Mosh Hamedani. 
    * It is the culmination of all of the Angular concepts that I have been learning for the past month.
* To create this app, I have coded alongside Mosh's videos; where applicable, I tweaked things to suit my preference. 
    * Due to time constraints, I did not attempt this project solo and then watch his solution retrospectively.
* As far as documentation goes, I will make the project itself living documentation and keep a ['tech ref'](./technicalreferences.md) for items of high importance. 
    * Mosh's video serve as documentation also, that I can go back to if necessary.
* I will attempt to get the test coverage as high as possible, time permitting
    * Ideally, 70% and beyond.
